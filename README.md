Brain tumor detection from MRI images with IBM Watson Studio
Brain tumor is one of the main causes of cancer death worldwide. Computer-aided diagnosis systems showed the potential for improving diagnostic accuracy. But early detection and prevention can significantly reduce the chances of death. It is important to detect Brain tumor as early as possible.

The goal is to classify images into two classifications of malignant and benign. As earlydiagnostics significantly increases the chances of correct treatment and survival. In application, we are helping the doctors and patients to classify the Type of   Tumour forthe specific image given with the help of Neural Networks.We will be using deep learning algorithm CNN, NumPy, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV andsome other deep learning techniques. We will do Flask Integration and IBM Watson Deployment also
